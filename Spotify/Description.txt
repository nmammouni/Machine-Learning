In the "Spotify Data Analysis 2023" project, We embarked on an in-depth exploration of Spotify's dataset to identify musical trends, user behaviors, and the dynamics of music streaming for the year 2023. Utilizing Python and tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn within a Jupyter Notebook framework, the project aimed to uncover the most streamed artists, tracks, genres, and user engagement patterns. Through meticulous data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and the application of machine learning models, the analysis shed light on peak streaming times, predictive factors for song popularity, and the emotional tone of lyrics in popular music. This comprehensive study not only highlights shifting musical tastes and engagement insights but also serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders in the music industry, demonstrating the critical role of data science in understanding and forecasting trends in music consumption.
